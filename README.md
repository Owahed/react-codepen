### React Codepen

The app will have a feature to create pens, which are individual code snippets that can be saved and shared with others. The pens can be written in multiple languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users will be able to view and edit the code in a live preview, so they can see the changes in real-time.

The application will be responsive, so it can be accessed on any device with a web browser, and it will be built to be fast, efficient, and easy to use.
